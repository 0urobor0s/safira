## How to Run?

To create a PostgreSQL container and a user, you just need to run:

```
make
```
After running this command your container is up-and-running.


If you want to stop the container, you just need to run:

```
make stop
```

If you stopped your docker, or container, for starting it again you just need to run:

```
make start
```
